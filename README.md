# CoinMarketCap - Filter coins/tokens by exchange
Filter lists of cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap.com by exchange(eg. Binance, Bitfinex, Cryptopia..)

Extension adds a dropdown to the CoinMarketCap website with a list of exchanges that CoinMarketCap tracks. When selecting an exchange in the dropdown only coins that are on that exchange will be visible in the list.

**NOTE: Extension only works with the data on the page.**

**If there are 100 coins in the list it will only filter those coins. It will not add new coins to give you a new list of 100 coins**
